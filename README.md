# Neo-Geo-Pocket-flash-cartridge
Board layout based on furrtek schematic: http://furrtek.free.fr/?p=crea&a=cartflash as he haven't since time released a typon.
There is one issue thought: the connector size, i don't know it, so i have no idea if my board layout will fit in a real neo geo pocket.


/!\ Don't produce for the moment /!\

or if you have a caliper and a NGP cartridge, feel free to correct the board size and rearrange connectors
You need also a cpld or another Uc to pass the verification check.
